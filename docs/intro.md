# Introduction

In development you run into a lot of common problems that have known general solutions.
This module is built by Ortho Games as a way to keep all our most useful functions in one place and make them available to the public.

# What kinds of things are in here?

OrthoUtil is a util of many functions that span across all possible use cases.

- Function Utilities

We use wally in order to manage our package dependency.

Add this line to your wally.toml file and then run `wally install`.
